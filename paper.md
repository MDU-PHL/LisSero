# Summary

One of the corner stones of transition to genomics in public health are Bioinformatic
tools to assist in replicating wet lab processes using whole-genome sequence data. A 
number of tools have been written to carry out various bacterial sub-typing techniques, 
such as multi-locus sequence typing, and various types of phenotypic serotype inferences
(e.g., *Salmonella* serotyping, and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* multi-antigen sequence typing). 
Here we present `LisSero`, a tool for performing *Listeria monocytogenes* *in silico* serotype
inferences based on draft assemblies obtained from whole-genome sequence data.
`LisSero` will add a valuable tool to the growing number of Bioinformatics tools
designed to provide backwards compatibility with data generated prior to the dissemination
of whole-genome sequencing technology.

# Statement of need 

`LisSero` is a Python package that automates the process of `BLASTing`
a set of contigs from a draft assembly of a *Listeria monocytogenes* genome
against a curated database of five genes. The serotype is assigned in accordance 
with the combination of identified genes [@doumithDifferentiationMajorListeria2004]. 
The five genes (NAME GENES) have been described as the minimum necessary 
to classify *L. monocytogenes* isolates into distinct serotypes of public health importance [@doumithDifferentiationMajorListeria2004].

`LisSero` was designed to provide an *in silico* replacement for the muliplex PCR
based *L monocytogenes* serotyping. We provide validation data, and demonstrate
the capability of the tool to recover the expected serotype from draft assemblies
of *L. monocytogenes*. The tool is important in providing backwards compatibility, 
allowing researchers and public health labs wishing to move to WGS the ability to 
compare their strains with previously available data. The tool is already use in routinely
in our lab, and it has already been used in a number of publications [@kwongProspectiveWholeGenomeSequencing2016, @toledoGenomicDiversityListeria2018, @bainesCompleteMicrobialGenomes2019a,
@knijnAdvancedResearchInfrastructure2020].
